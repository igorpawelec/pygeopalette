"""The package claims requires-python >= 3.9. Check that it means it.

Ported from pyHRG, which shipped 0.5.0 with ``max_iters: int | None`` and did
not import at all on 3.9: PEP 604 in an annotation is a runtime expression
before 3.10. It was invisible there because development runs on 3.12, and CI
caught it only after the tag. GeoPalette is clean today — this is what keeps
it clean, and it is not idle: ``geopalette/io_utils.py`` does use ``str | Path``, and is legal only
because it carries ``from __future__ import annotations`` on the line after
its docstring. Move that import down past an assignment and the package
stops importing everywhere; the second test below is what notices.
